You are a member of the scientific team at Nova-76, a research base specializing in experiments with portals between Earth and Hell.
The scientists hoped that by opening the gate, they would gain unlimited access to new energy sources.
One day, an emergency signal is received - something has gone terribly wrong.
The attempt to link both worlds has spiraled out of control. When you return to the base after some time to investigate what happened, a horrifying sight unfolds before you.
The base is abandoned...
It seems like you are the only survivor...
but are you truly alone?

Your mission is to uncover the truth and close the portal.
GOOD LUCK...
